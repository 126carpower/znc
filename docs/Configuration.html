<h2>
 File Locations
</h2>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Config</strong> - ZNC gets its configuration by reading the file ~/.znc/znc.conf
<li> <strong>Misc</strong> - Other files are also stored in the ~/.znc directory such as the SSL cert (znc.pem) and PidFile (znc.pid).
<li> <strong>Local Modules</strong> - Stored in ~/.znc/modules.  ZNC will look in the local module dir first when trying to load a module.
<li> <strong>Global Modules</strong> - Stored in /usr/share/znc/modules by default.
<li> <strong>Binaries</strong> - znc, znc-config, and zncchk are all stored in /usr/bin by default.  You can change this when you configure by using <em>./configure --prefix=/whatever/path/you/want</em>
</ul>
<h2>
 Config File - (~/.znc/znc.conf)

<li> <strong>ListenPort</strong> - The port that ZNC will listen on.  If the port is prepended with a '+' then ZNC listens using ssl.

<li> <strong>KeepBuffer</strong> - Buffer channels while you are attached and play the whole buffer back to you each time you connect.
